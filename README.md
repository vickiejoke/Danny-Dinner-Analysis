# Danny-Dinner-Analysis
# From Data to Insights: Analyzing Restuarant Sales With SQL
# Introduction

I will walk you through an analysis project I undertook for a fictional diner, Danny’s Diner. The goal was to analyze sales data, menu pricing, and membership information to derive meaningful insights. The analysis was conducted using SQL, and this post will detail the schema, data processing, and the subsequent analytical queries performed.

# Data Processing

To start, I loaded the schema for `dannys_diner`. Within this schema, three tables were provided: `sales`, `menu`, and `members`.

# Sales Table

The `sales` table captures each sale transaction, recording the customer ID, the order date, and the product ID.

# Members Table

The `members` table tracks customer memberships, recording when each customer joined the membership program.

# Analytical Queries

I performed several analytical queries to extract insights from the data.

# Revenue by Customer

I calculated the total revenue generated from each customer.

# Analyzing Customer Visits

I examined how many days each customer visited the restaurant. This helps us see how often customers come back, which is useful for improving marketing and customer service.

# First Purchase Analysis

I looked at the first item each customer bought to understand initial preferences and what attracts new customers.

# Last Purchase Before Membership:

I analyzed the significance of the item a customer purchased before becoming a member and how it can provide insights into consumer behavior and membership conversion strategies.

# Pre-Membership Purchases

 I analyzed how many items each person bought and how much they spent,before becoming members.

# Post-Membership Purchases
I analyzed items first puchased after the customers became members.

# Points Calculation with Multipliers

This part explains how customers earn points. For every $1 spent, you get 10 points. Also, when you buy sushi, you earn double the points.

# Conclusion
